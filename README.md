# GitPracticeKCC
Below are screenshots of the history of commands I did for this repository in GitBash. This repository was then imported from my local machine to this github repository. I can only provide screenshots of this because the project did not state what was required to be submitted so I had no knowledge of what to submit until after I completed the project. 
I followed along with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw and completed all those steps.
