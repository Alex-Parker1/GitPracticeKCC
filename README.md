# GitPracticeKCC
Below are the screenshots for the GitHub project.

In this first screenshot I was looking at the directory content because I had already created directories that would contain this practice. I had already initialised a git repo on the desired directory using the git init command. After this, I then created an index file to practice with.

I then added a sentence to the file and carried out the git add command to add my changes to the git staging area. I then committed my changes to git using the git commit command.

Here I created a new branch and printed out the active branches to see the branch I had created.

Here I changed back to the old branch and then checked the status of the branches and the git repo. Adding and committing the changes again.

Here I merged the branches together and deleted the now redundant branch.

I then linked this repo on my local machine to an online remote repositories in my Github.
